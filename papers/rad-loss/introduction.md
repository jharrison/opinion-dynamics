## Introduction

This paper presents an agent-based model of individual radicalization based on the work of Cioffi [@cioffi2011pandemonium] and Kruglanski (ref). Opinions are modeled using a variation of the continuous bounded confidence model introduced by [@deffuant2000mixing] and expanded by [@jager2005uniformity] to include a rejection mechanism based on Social Judgment Theory [@sherif1961social].
